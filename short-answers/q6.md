# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - returns a boolean immediately indicating if the request was successful

2. `Response.status` - returns an indication if the response was successful and explains why if it wasn't

3. `Response.url` - returns the serialized URL of the response or an empty string if the URL is null

4. `Response.headers` - returns the headers object associated with the response
